** Emacs Lisp :priority:
- Auto completion broke at some point, figure out how to fix it

* Things to Try
** use-package: cleaner package management
Figure out how to setup hooks that can be reloaded!
** avy: faster navigation
replacement for ace-jump
** ivy: replace ido
** helm: nested filtering
** remacs: Emacs ported to rust
* Improve Emacs
- Auto update dired
- Horizontal scrolling
- Modeline
 - Don't care about minor modes
 - Try to get it similar to the doom-theme screenshots
- Inspect element for emacs (setting font faces, etc...)
- Browse through online git repo (github) without download
  - http + git protocols for tramp
- Requries modifiying C mode
  - Seperate the echo area and the minibuffer so I don't get interrupted while typing
  - Pixel-level scrolling

* Improve a Package
** restclient
- create content-type mappings from extension mappings
  - eg. application/json => .js => js2-mode
- provide option for custom content-type mappings
- provide option for custom beautifiers

** Doom Themes
- Fix weird GUI bugs with emacsclient (possibly related to DPI scaling)
- Compare theme in high dpi vs low dpi to improve scaling consistency

** Straight
- 2048-game (can't install, uses hg instead of git?)
- slime & yasnippet repos seem to change when they are built
- Repos checked out at a specific revision instead of on master
*** Updating packages                                              :priority:
- Do not prompt at all if there there are no changes made to the repo
- Make it less annoying to update packages installed with lockfile
- Automatically build packages after pull

** ag-mode :priority:
- Only open buffer temporarily when using 'next-error-follow-minor-mode'
