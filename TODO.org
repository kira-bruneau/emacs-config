* Things to Try
** use-package: cleaner package management
Figure out how to setup hooks that can be reloaded!
** ivy: replace ido
** rtags: alternative to ggtags for C/C++
** irony: better editing for C/C++
** multifiles: view multiple files in one buffer
** grizzl: indexed fuzzy searching
** attrap: flycheck fix error at point

* Improve Emacs
- Auto update dired
- Horizontal scrolling
- Modeline
 - Don't care about minor modes
 - Try to get it similar to the doom-theme screenshots
- Inspect element for emacs (setting font faces, etc...)
- Browse through online git repo (github) without download
  - http + git protocols for tramp
- Requries modifiying C mode
  - Seperate the echo area and the minibuffer so I don't get interrupted while typing
  - Pixel-level scrolling

* Improve a Package
** restclient
- create content-type mappings from extension mappings
  - eg. application/json => .js => js2-mode
- provide option for custom content-type mappings
- provide option for custom beautifiers

** straight
- Repos checked out at a specific revision instead of on master

- Do not prompt at all if there there are no changes made to the repo
- Make it less annoying to update packages installed with lockfile
- Automatically build packages after pull
