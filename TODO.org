* Things to Try
** multifiles: view multiple files in one buffer

* Improve Emacs
- Horizontal scrolling
- Inspect element for emacs (setting font faces, etc...)
- Browse through online git repo (github) without download
  - http + git protocols for tramp
- Requries modifiying C mode
  - Seperate the echo area and the minibuffer so I don't get interrupted while typing
  - Pixel-level scrolling (this is now available, but too slow)
- Async delete in dired

* Improve a Package
** restclient
- provide option for custom beautifiers

** counsel-fzf
- create server around fzf, so I don't have to use a tty interface for fast results
  - results should load incrementally like they do in ripgrep

** magit
- provide a way to easily switch to buffer interface from transient interface
- switch between find file and search in file in projectile
